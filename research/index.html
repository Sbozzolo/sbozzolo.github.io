<h2 id="numerical-relativity-and-gravitational-wave-astronomy">Numerical relativity and gravitational wave astronomy</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, my research focuses on strongly gravitating systems, such as
black holes and neutron stars. I develop and use computational methods and codes
to tackle problems in strong gravity and I primarily work in numerical
relativity, field that is concerned with finding numerical solutions to the
equations of general relativity. I am deeply interested in using simulations to
push our physical theories to their limits and learn more about fundamental
physics. One of the main ways I am doing this is by using gravitational waves to
interface with observations and experiments. Gravitational waves (detected for
the first time in 2015) offer a completely new way to study the universe and are
providing invaluable data to address long standing questions.</p>

</figure>
<p>Einstein-Maxwellâ€™s theory is the most fundamental description of
electromagnetism and gravity, and several far-reaching results on black holes
were found in this context (e.g., the no-hair theorem). Since
astrophysically-relevant black holes are believed to have negligible electric
charge, the theory has been mostly confined within the realm of theoretical
investigation. Consequently, interacting charged black holes represent a largely
unexplored territory. I apply numerical-relativity techniques to perform
simulations of such systems. I mostly focus on systems with two black holes with
extreme non-linear interaction. One main target of this investigation is
quasi-circular inspirals of black holes, which are possible sources for current
and future gravitational-wave detectors. I developed the formalism and codes to
perform long-term and stable simulations of these charged binary black holes.
Among the most important new components, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.104044">I
built</a>
<code>TwoChargedPunctures</code>, and <code>QuasiLocalMeasuresEM</code>, which provide a quasi-local
description of horizons in numerical relativity. Using <a href="https://einsteintoolkit.org"><code>Einstein Toolkit</code></a> and the
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5520862">canuda</a> codes, I performed the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.041103">first
general-relativistic simulations of quasi-circular inspirals of charged black
holes from constraint-satisfying initial
data</a>.
From these calculations, I extracted gravitational waves and placed the first
constraints on black-hole charge with LIGO/Virgo data.</p>
<p>I believe that charged black holes are a perfect laboratory where to learn about
the interplay between extreme gravitational and electromagnetic fields, the
understanding of which could be relevant also for other astrophysical
applications. For instance, I showed that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.071101">charge does not matter in
ultrarelativistic collisions of black
holes</a>,
result that has implications for the formation of microscopic black holes in
particle accelerators and that continues in a new existing direction a line of
research that started a decade ago. Moreover, the mathematical framework used to
describe charged black holes can be employed for a large variety of different
physical systems, such as modified theories of gravity.</p>

    <img style="margin: 2px;" src="../media/hybrid_star.png" width="250">
    <figcaption>Special neutron star with a quark core</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The study of neutron stars brings together several different fields ranging from
astrophysics and gravitation to particle and nuclear physics. My research
focuses on rotating neutron stars, the properties of which are significantly
different compared to the static case. I studied stability properties of
differentially rotating compact stars and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/3557/4655057">found new universal
relations</a>.</p>
<p>Astronomical observations of compact stars are an interesting avenue to
constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. I am particularly
interested in equations of state with a phase transition, from hadronic matter
to quarks, which give rise to <em>hybrid stars</em>. I studied <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/i2019-12831-2">rotating hybrid
stars</a> and found
that some universal relations do not hold anymore.</p>
<p>I am generally interested in dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations (GRMHD), and I contributed to extend
<code>IllinoisGRMHD</code> to support finite temperature, realistic equations of states.</p>

    <figcaption>Merger of two black holes surrounded by hot gas</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The future is going to be exciting. In the late 2030s, the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA) will detect for the first time gravitational waves from
mergers of supermassive black holes. Most galaxies harbor such black holes at
their centers, so mergers of supermassive black holes will likely have
electromagnetic afterglows that are due to the hot plasma inspiraling towards
the horizons. We are also building new powerful telescopes that will be able to
detect such transients. Coincident detection of gravitational and
electromagnetic waves from supermassive black holes (&ldquo;multimessenger&rdquo;) will
enable leaps in several areas of astronomy, cosmology, and fundamental physics.
Currently, our theoretical model for the electromagnetic signals near merger are
not refined enough, and we will not be able to extract physical quantities from
future observations. To advance our models, I am developing a full general
relativistic ray tracing and radiation transfer code to find accurate
observational signatures for systems near merger.</p>
<h2 id="high-performance-computing-and-software-development">High-performance computing and software development</h2>
<p>Numerical relativity and gravitational-wave astronomy are fields driven by data
and computation, hence software plays an important part of my life.
General-relativistic simulations are computationally demanding, routinely
requiring weeks or months to be completed. For this reason, I have deep interest
and solid expertise in high-performance and parallel computing. In my day-to-day
life, I develop codes that run on thousands of processors on the most powerful
supercomputers in US and Europe. To be honest, this interest is only a small
subset of my broader and long-standing passion for programming and computer
science. I strongly believe in open-source software, and I develop software to
serve the community, making sure that my projects are well documented and
accessible. You can find a list of software I develop or maintain in the
<a href="../software">Software</a> page.</p>
