<h2 id="numerical-relativity">Numerical relativity</h2>
<p>General relativity is one of the most famous and well-established physical
theories. The first formulation is due to Albert Einstein and it is more than
100 years old. Despite the age, it was only with the advent of computers that
scientists managed to unlock some of the most ground-braking predictions of the
theory, such as detailed models for gravitational waves. Putting general
relativity on a computer was no easy task and an entire new branch of physics
was born in the effort. I specialize in this field, known as <em>numerical
relativity</em>. Today, we can perform successful numerical-relativity simulations
of several different systems and build models that guide and explain
astronomical observations. In my research, I apply numerical-relativity
techniques to study binary systems, and I extend our computational and
theoretical methods for numerical relativity in general.</p>

<h3 id="charged-black-holes">Charged black holes</h3>
<p>General relativity is a rich theory and there is still a lot to be understood.
One of the areas that is poorly explored is the nonlinear interaction between
extreme gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Here, with &rsquo;nonlinear&rsquo; we
essentially mean &lsquo;so complicated that only computers can do it&rsquo;. These studies
can help us shed more light on some fundamental properties of the Universe and
how our theories behave under the most extreme conditions.</p>

    <figcaption>Merger of black holes surrounded by hot gas</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In 2015, the scientific community detected for the first time gravitational
waves, ripple in the spacetime that are caused by mergers of black holes.
Gravitational waves allow us to look at the universe in a completely new way,
enabling leap in our scientific knowledge. Binary black holes surrounded by a
very hot gas constitute a prime target for gravitational-wave searches. These
systems are particularly interesting because they can also be detected with
traditional telescopes, enabling what is known as <em>multimessenger astronomy</em>. I
simulate binary black holes near merger to develop theoretical models to explain
and interpret astronomical observations.</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the possible endpoints of the life of a star is to explode and leave
behind a remnant of the size of a small city. These objects are known as
<em>neutron stars</em> and are incredibly different compared to anything we can find of
Earth. Scientists are extremely interested in neutron stars because they are
unique laboratories where we can test our theories, expanding the boundaries of
what we know. In my research, I focus on a rotating neutron stars and their
special properties, and on stars with a <em>quark</em> core (a core made only by the
most fundamental particles that we currently know of).</p>
<h2 id="high-performance-computing-and-software-development">High-performance computing and software development</h2>
<p>Numerical relativity is a field driven by data and code. Therefore, software and
algorithm development is an important part of my work. I am deeply interested in
improving the computational tools of my community, so I am develop high-quality
public code that anyone can use and expand upon.</p>
